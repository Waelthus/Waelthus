## Michael Walther

Hi, I'm  Michael Walther, a postdoctoral researcher in the group for Astrophysics, Cosmology and Artificial Intelligence at the [university observatory Munich](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/) which is part of [Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich, Germany](https://www.lmu.de). Previously I worked at [CEA Saclay, France](https://www.cea.fr), [UC Santa Barbara, US](https://www.ucsb.edu) and [MPIA Heidelberg, Germany](https://www.mpia.de).

## Work topics

I'm focusing my work on observations of the Lyman-α forest and its cosmological as well as astrophysical interpretation using cosmological simulations.

Currently I'm involved in the Dark Energy spectroscopic instrument ([DESI](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/)) survey working on measurements of the Lyα forest power spectrum based on observations of high redshift quasar spectra.
To simulate the intergalactic medium that creates this forest, I also performed hydrodynamical simulations with the [Nyx code](https://github.com/AMReX-Astro/Nyx) of up to 4096<sup>3</sup> resolution elements ([see here for a video showing the evolution of a single slice through a box](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TxFsqYeJGOIXoiB1XKUSwxNPq6yJSpU6/view?resourcekey)).
The main goal of this work is to obtain more accurate constraints on warm dark matter (WDM), the neutrino mass Σm<sub>ν</sub> and inflationary parameters.
Furthermore, I am working on improvements of the CCD level calibrations for DESI within the [desispec](https://github.com/desihub/desispec) project and am (together with our local PhD student [Parth Nayak](https://gitlab.physik.uni-muenchen.de/Parth.Nayak)) investigating new approaches of Lyα forest analysis based on machine learning techniques.

Previously, I have been working on constraining thermal evolution in the Intergalactic medium using high-resolution Lyα forest observations from the VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES spectrographs.
